        <p>This podcast is the product of Noah Gibbs, and of a large and supportive community willing to share their experiences, to listen and share, and to offer feedback.</p>

<p>There was also a teddy bear and a stuffed chimpanzee involved. If you have really good models, why not take <strong><em>lots</em></strong> of photos, right?</p>

<p>You know that time in class when somebody asks, &ldquo;when are we ever <strong><em>really going to use this</em></strong>?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a hard question for a student or a teacher to answer. Some of the stuff that gets taught is, frankly, useless. Some of it&rsquo;s incredibly powerful. A <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of it depends on what you wind up doing for a living afterward. I can tell you which bits were useful for me, but I can&rsquo;t tell you which were useful for <strong><em>everybody</em></strong>.</p>

<p>You know who <strong><em>can</em></strong> tell you that? Everybody.</p>

<p>So I invite them on the podcast.</p>

<h2>The Interviews</h2>

<p>More specifically, I look for working software developers who can answer, &ldquo;which parts of this are useful to a working software developer?&rdquo; I have a guest for each episode, and I try to have a topic or three that we decide ahead of time. That way we don&rsquo;t wind up with a long pause while the guest and I both try to think of something interesting to say.</p>

<p>Sometimes we stay pretty close to the prearranged topic. Sometimes it goes all over the place. That&rsquo;s what happens when you ask everybody! I like it. I hope you do too.</p>

<h2>The Results</h2>

<p>I have a lot of these prerecorded and I&rsquo;m putting them out every week. I&rsquo;m on UK time, so sometimes the timing may be weird for you. Mea culpa!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently trying to do a transcription and set of URLs for all the episodes. It&rsquo;s a lot of work, so no clue if I&rsquo;ll stick with it. I think it makes the result a lot more valuable! I just also have three kids.</p>
