quick_summary: "Jared and I talk about his journey through all sorts of programming platforms, from the Commodore 128, through PHP to Ruby and onward. He talks about Object Oriented programming, Rails service objects and why he doesn't like classes that are just functions. He talks about how GitHub brings a little of the benefits of pair programming to the single-programmer experience. We even talk a little language performance, and how machine learning code looks weirdly like graphics and GPGPU."

Jared runs a small boutique web design company out of Portland and works on [BridgeTown](https://bridgetownrb.com), a Ruby static site generator. You can find him on Twitter as [JaredCWhite](https://twitter.com/jaredcwhite).
