Larry has 15 years' experience in the military under his belt, and is still training as a software developer. We talk about the up-and-coming developer experience, before his first job and what they're looking for. We also talk about social change, and how different the software world is from most of the real world. A little psychology, a little social science, a certain amount of ethics...

A great conversation, all told.

Larry is also dyslexic, and we talk about how he handles that, and how it's changed all those other things we talk about.
