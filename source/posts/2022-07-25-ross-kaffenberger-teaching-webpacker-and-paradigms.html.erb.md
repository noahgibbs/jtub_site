Oh man, my audio quality is AWFUL here. Luckily Ross's is better and he's great at carrying the conversation!

We talk about how Ross "cheats" both to get into teaching and to get into tech, and about some overlap between the two -- we talk about Seymour Papert, of course. Later we get into different paradigms of programming and what you learn from them, as well as the balance between being a generalist and a specialist.

Ross has done a lot with WebPacker -- WebPacker and the asset pipeline are a lot like Bundler as a way to control the Wild West of dependency management.
