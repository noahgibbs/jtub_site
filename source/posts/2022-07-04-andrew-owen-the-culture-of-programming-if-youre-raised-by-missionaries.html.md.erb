I barely know how to summarise this one. It's one of my favourites. Andrew is from dot-NET rather than Ruby. He was raised by missionaries, and is thus extremely literate about cultures and how to introduce yourself into a new one. He sees a lot of what I see from a very enlightened outsider's perspective. Which is like catnip to me, just so we're clear.

We talk about how often learning programming *skill* is a side effect of learning programming *culture*. Also about affordances - what particular languages, cultures and tools encourage, not just what they enable. Powerful stuff.

Correction from Andrew:

"So, I did a bit of looking, and the code generator guy wasn't djb, it was Peter Hintjens, who worked with a program called GSL (Generator Script Langauge). He's most famous for working on zeromq.

That, to me, would probably be how I'd use Ruby, to try to combine expressiveness and performance. Though, I don't know for sure. https://github.com/imatix/gsl is the repo for it.

I wish I'd remembered it properly on the show."

We all have trouble remembering trivia when we're put on the spot! At least, I certainly do.
