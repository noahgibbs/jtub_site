This episode is with me, my wife Krissy and Akien McIain, a mutual friend who is also a very senior test automation engineer. When two old engineers get together to talk, you can always expect a lot of war stories... But more importantly, a lot of this is a compare/contrast between developers, QA and test automation. What's similar? What's different? How do the two groups related to each other on the job?

And when you get outside 'normal' software dev jobs, the career path is less clear. How do you prepare for something when there's not a degree program? What does the path through that career look like? We talk a lot about how to make the right kind of mistakes to keep moving forward. And that's useful for anybody.
