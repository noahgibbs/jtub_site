Caitlyn didn't want to go back and get a degree "at my age", but went to Thinkful to learn to be a full-stack software engineer, which is "like being paid to go to school and make cool things forever." It's hard to tell what to focus on when there's so much to learn. "It used different muscles in my brain," she says, as she "learn[ed] to work from a place of frustration." And in the end, "it's either a good time or a good story!"
