quick_summary: "We talk a fair bit about careers, the difficulties of dealing with clients and how computer assistance may be the future."

We talk about how Craig got started, of course, and about buzzwords and how he did his early job hunting. We talk a *lot* about Ruby performance - who's who, what matters, what's annoying.

We veer a bit into how Pina Coladas shouldn't use dark rum (heresy!) and about the example of Centaur Chess, and how it related to other human/computer interactions.
