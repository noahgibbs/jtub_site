quick_summary: "Tobi and I talk about education and *so* much software history, including the interesting points of a lot of languages."
---

Tobi works at Shopify and is the author of benchee, an Elixir-language benchmarking suite. He runs RUG:B, a Berlin-based Ruby group, maintains SimpleCov and... Lots of stuff. I always feel tired looking at all the stuff Rubyists do :-)

Tobi had a pretty extensive formal computer science education, and it's served him well. We also talk about a lot of different Ruby implementations, and various Ruby folks he's met.

We also manage to cover a ridiculous variety of different languages and topics, and lots of older software history. He's a very computer-history-literate fellow!
