    <h1>Computer Science: Just the Useful Bits</h1>

    <p>
        If you're a real working software developer, which bits of computer science are useless? Which are useful? And which ones are superpowers?
    </p>

    <p>
        Every episode I talk to working developers from all different backgrounds about different
        topics in computer science. From different data structures, algorithms, analysis, mathematics and software techniques and practices, we talk about which ones matter in their day-to-day work, and what kind of work that is.
